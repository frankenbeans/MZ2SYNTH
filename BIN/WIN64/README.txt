README.txt - WIN64 executables
------------------------------

This is the home of auto-generated WIN64 executables.  I have not
tested these beyond, in the nightly-build action script, starting the
executable in -help mode to see whether the program starts and prints
textual output.  The executables require the Mingw-W64 runtime to
work.
