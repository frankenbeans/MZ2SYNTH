MacOS Executable Generated by Github Action (NIGHTLY)
-----------------------------------------------------

Generated using GFortran 13 on the 'macos-latest' runner.  I have no way to really
test these executables on my own system, but the build runs the executable in "-help"
mode to verify that it starts and produces its help-screen.

Please report any problems in the Discussion and I will try my best to assist.
