# TODO for MZ2SYNTH

## IMMEDIATE
- Test repository contents to see that it is complete and builds without warnings.
  - NB:  original local copy already builds with no warnings
- Write basic usage instructions
- Make public, warts and all

## MEDIUM TERM
- Tidy up source code
  - lots of styles, lots of header formats, etc.
  - Fortran 2008 required to build, see if can modify to allow Fortran 2003 only
- Write proper documentation (manual page + tutorial information)
- Supply template files and examples
